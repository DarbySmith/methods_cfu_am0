# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    * I feel okay about it. It is overwhelming how many there are, so I'm still learning how to find exactly what I want in the resources.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    * I feel okay writing simple methods by myself. I need more practice.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    * I am working on rationalizing the syntax. I wanted to put quotation marks around the arguments, but since it is kind of similar to a variable is that why there are no quotation marks?
